# TPJava_Script_City

## Project Overview

The objective of this exercise is to create, using several classes, a city system working with the outside world and the divine world. This city must interact with its god, and the neighboring cities, for example, by declaring wars, carrying on a trade, or making gifts to the said god.


## Installation and run
```sh
yarn
yarn run start
```

## Functions
```
The project is divided by four main classes
    -City :
        *Everything is managed in the city. It deals with the favor and
        retribution from the gods, the army and the tradings.
    -Soldier :
        *It instantiates the army and defines the life expectancy by the age 
        of the soldiers.
        *It also defines the attack and the defense. The frequency of those
        methods is defined in the index.
    -Trading : 
        *It defines when it's summer or winter. Those parameters are linked 
        to a function in City that adds more corn if it's summer and delete
        some otherwise.
    -Divinity : 
        *Divinity initiates the world events and the favor from the gods. 
        *The purcentage of the blessing's, favor and retribution frequencies 
        is also defined here.
